39816885,Efficacy of psychomotor therapy for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders-a systematic literature review.,"Specific Phobia (SP), Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD), and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) are the most prevalent anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Although anxiety has a major influence on the body, evidence-based treatments mainly focus on cognitive and behavioral aspects of anxiety. Body- and movement-oriented interventions, such as psychomotor therapy (PMT), address the physical aspects. Bodily experience and interoceptive awareness are used to change behavior, cognition, and emotions. This review aimed to provide an overview of the efficacy of PMT for children and adolescents aged 0-18 years with SP, GAD, or SAD. Data were collected in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, ERIC, and Web of Science, from January 2020 until April 2022. Two independent researchers (EV and JM) selected the articles and performed a critical appraisal. From 1,438 articles found, only one article met the inclusion criteria. No consensus-based statement about the efficacy of PMT in children and adolescents with SP, GAD, or SAD can be made due to the gap in the literature. Future research is needed to evaluate the efficacy. The first step may be to design treatment protocols. Subsequently, these protocols may be evaluated concerning efficacy.",2023,Frontiers in child and adolescent psychiatry,Journal Article,2023,YES,keyword fallback,,,,,,
39478846,Tolerance of Bupropion SR After Delayed-Onset Urticaria and Angioedema Associated With Bupropion XL.,"Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and smoking cessation. It is also used off-label for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Its mechanism of action includes the selective norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). The drug is available in immediate-release (IR), sustained-release (SR), and extended-release (XL) formulations. Common side effects are typically mild and include anxiety, insomnia, headache, dizziness, constipation, and nausea. Rarely, cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions may occur. We describe a 23-year-old man who developed severe and diffuse urticaria and angioedema 4 weeks after initiation of bupropion XL for MDD and ADHD. The bupropion was stopped, and he was treated with levocetirizine, diphenhydramine (oral and topical), and methylprednisolone with complete resolution of his symptoms within 2 weeks. Due to a good initial therapeutic response to the medication, a trial of bupropion SR was initiated. The patient again had a favorable therapeutic response without any dermatologic side effects.",2024,Case reports in psychiatry,Journal Article,2024,YES,keyword fallback,,,,,,
